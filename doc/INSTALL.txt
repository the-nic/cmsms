Requirements:
    PHP 4+
    MySQL
    Apache webserver (or another php enabled webserver)
    BBCodeParser (optional)


1.  Untar the source package to document root dir or your webserver
        - cd DOCUMENT_ROOT
        - tar xvfz cms-VERSION.tar.gz
OR
    check out the latest version from subversion
        - svn co http://svn.cmsmadesimple.org/cms/trunk

----- If your webserver has write access to your new CMS directory you can skip step 2 ------
2.  create an empty config.php file and make it writable by your webserver's user:
        - touch config.php
        - chmod 666 config.php 

3.  Create the cms database and grant a user rights to use it:
        - login to mysql: mysql -u root -p
            create database cms;
            grant all privileges on cms.* to cms_user@localhost identified by 'cms_pass';
            quit

4.  Fix the permissions on the cache and template compilation directories so the web server has access to them.
        - chmod 777 tmp/templates_c
	- chmod 777 tmp/cache
	- chmod 777 uploads
	- chmod 777 uploads/images

5.  Open up your new CMS site in your webbrowser and you will be guided through a short install.

6.  After install, for security sake, you should set your config.php back to a read-only state.
        - chmod 444 config.php

7.  To reach the admin of your site, point your browser to: http://yoursiteurl/admin/

Admin features including user management, template management, section management, and of course content management can all be accessed at your CMSROOT/admin.

Optional: 

8.  Some setup parameters are set to a default value and are not editable through the webinterface.
    Although CMS works out-of-the-box, you might still want to edit these parameters
    	
   	- open config.php with you favorite editor (this file has been created by the installer)

    Some of the parameters you can find here are:
		    
	The image manipulation library used by the Image manager, either 'GD' or 'NetPBM' or 'IM' for ImageMagick. 
        - $config["image_manipulation_prog"] = "GD";        
        If the library is NetPBM or IM, you need to specify where the binary for the selected library are.
        -  $config["image_transform_lib_path"] = "/usr/bin/ImageMagick/";
	The location (filepath and URL) to which files are uploaded using the filemanager
	- $config["uploads_path"] = "/site/web/cms/uploads";
	- $config["uploads_url"] = "http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/cms/uploads";
	The location (filepath and URL) to which files are uploaded using the imagemanager. This can be the same path as the image manager URL
	- $config["image_uploads_path"] = "/site/web/cms/uploads/images";
	- $config["image_uploads_url"] = "http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/cms/uploads/images";
    	CMS features a realtime HTML validation plugin for the WYSIWYG editor, which will insure valid HTML content
        This is turned off by default, since it will also disable the use of tables and markup tags.
        - $config["use_Indite"] = false;
