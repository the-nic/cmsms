To order this beta theme testing work for now just folow this steps:


1) Wend i do the changes you must have to copy this files content and paste in your cms-DB-template
Template:         File-Ncleanblue.txt
Menu Template:    File-Menu-Nncleanblue.txt




images and other stuff in uploads/NCleanblue/*




------------------------------------------



I know is sucks but there is no way todo better!

At the end of the beta cicle and after all testes we import this into normal way.


Sorry if you have a better idea let me know!
