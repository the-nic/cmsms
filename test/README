Testing is using phpspec. See:
http://phpspec.org

Install like so (might need sudo):
pear channel-discover pear.phpspec.org
pear install phpspec/PHPSpec

And run from this directory like:
phpspec -r --specdoc

This does use the current database set in config.php.  They're generally not 
descructive, but the content stuff is a bit messy.
