To order this beta theme testing work for now just folow this steps:


1) Wend i do the changes you must have to copy this files content and paste in your cms-DB-template

Page Template:         File-Ncleanblue.txt
Menu Template:         File-Menu-Nncleanblue.txt

  a)   Creat a new menu template with name:  "Menu-NCleanBlue"  and put  "minimal_menu.tpl" as default
  b)   Creat a new page template with name:  "NCleanBlue"



2)  IMPORTANT  Search template must be  "Restore To Defaults"


images and other stuff are in uploads/NCleanblue/*




------------------------------------------



I know is sucks but there is no way todo better!

At the end of the beta cicle and after all testes we import this into normal way.


Sorry if you have a better idea let me know!
