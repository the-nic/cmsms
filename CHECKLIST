Steps of a (hopefully) successful cms release

1. Update ChangeLog, AUTHORS, README, INSTALL
2. Make sure GPL header is on all relevant files
3. Make sure COPYING is included
4. (optional) Make sure smarty is up to date
5. Update version.php with new version number
6. Commit
7. Make tag (e.g. tags/version-0.1)
8. Checkout tag in new directory
9. Run cleanup script (removes unwanted files)
10. Tarball up.  Format is cmsmadesimple-0.1.tar.gz.  Always untars into a cmsmadesimple-0.1 directory.
11. Upload to sourceforge.  Make sure ChangeLog is added.
12. Update topic in irc channel
13. Update news and downloads page with new version #, links and MD5 sum
14. Add news item on sourceforge project.  Sometimes these end up on the sf.net front page.  Good place to be.
15. Submit to freshmeat
16. Await fame and fortune :)
