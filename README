These set of scripts belong to each other:

  svn-propset
  svn-propset-file
  find-mime

svn-propset is the primary script. It sets predefined svn properties
on predefined file types. See 'svn-propset --help' for more info.

Typical usage:

  * On the first run : svn-propset --force

    All defined properties for all defined files are set.

  * on later runs    : svn-propset

    A specific property for a file will only be set if that property
    for that file is not present.

I M P O R T A N T :
===================
After setting of the properties, the changes will *automatically* be committed,
*unless* the -n or the --no-commit option is passed.
